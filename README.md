# 🌍Countries API Project

This project demonstrates how to interact with a public REST API to retrieve, process, and explore country-level data using Python.

## 📌 Description

Using the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/), this notebook performs the following:

- Sends HTTP requests to retrieve country data (name, capital, population, region, etc.)
- Parses and transforms JSON responses
- Handles API errors and missing data gracefully
- Filters and organizes the output for readability
- Explores specific cases (e.g., countries by population or region)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- `Python`
- `requests`
- `json`
- Jupyter Notebook
